Live Demo at http://wvrzel.github.io/GetPercByCircles/

GetPercByCircles is a small javascript-css libary which offers a friendly circle / pie-chart shaped userinterface for setting percentage values.

There are three supported colors: blue, green and red.

If you put serveral of these circles on one page, they will prevent the user from choosing values, so that the total sum would be > 100 %.

Have fun.
